/**
 * <pre>
 * Let us say you have a stair case
 * 
 * From each stair, instead of stepping onto the next stair, let us say you have an option to jump
 * upto k steps. You will be given an array of integers representing this k for each step.
 * 
 * Find out the minimum number of steps taken to reach from first stair to last stair.
 * 
 * e.g. Given the array containing for each step, the maximum number of steps that one can jump
 * 1	2	5	0	1	7
 * 
 * The minimum number of steps to reach from step i to top step is as follows
 * 2	2	1	Inf	1	0
 * So, in 2 steps one can reach from first step to top step
 *
