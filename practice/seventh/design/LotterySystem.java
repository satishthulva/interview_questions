 * 24 hours of the day are divided into 24 slots. A winner is drawn at the end of every slot. 
 * The winner has to be from the set of tickets sold in that slot only.
 * Winner is given 1 million rupees. Every other ticket is given anything between 0 to 9 rupees randomly.

 * Assume that there are 1 million tickets sold in each slot on an average. Assume that once the slot finishes and winner is drawn,
 * almost everybody who bought the ticket would come to the system and try to find out how much money they won come the next hour. In case
 * a person did not check with the system in the next hour, you allow that person to check till a month passes after which that person has 
 * to forego the money won.
