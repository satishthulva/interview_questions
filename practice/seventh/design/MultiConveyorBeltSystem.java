 * <pre>
 * Design a multi-conveyor belt system where conveyor belts are interlocked.
 * 
 * There is feeder which feeds material onto the first belt. The feeder is connected to a motor which has to be run
 * so that the material will go to the belt.
 * 
 * Each belt has a motor. When that motor is run, belt operates. Each belt has a load cell also which detects the material
 * being present on the belt. 
 * 
 * Design this system
