 * <pre>
 * Let us say you have a document which contains words made of lower case letters from English alphabet. Each word in the document 
 * is separated by space. Assume words are numbered starting from 1.
 * 
 * There will be queries on given document. Input for the query are two words w1 and w2. 
 * The output has to be the minimum distance between the words in the document.
 * 
 * Assume that the document is very large and the number of queries also can be a lot.
 * 
 * Design an API to answer the queries.
 * 
 * 		 1	 2		3		4  5	6	 7	 8		9
 * e.g. the king summoned all his people to his darbar
 * 
 * minDistance(his, people)  -->	0 because there are two instances of his in the document - 5 and 8
 * and there is one instance of people - 6. The minimum distance is 0 because 5 and 6 are next to each other 
 * 
 * Solve this first.
 * 
 * Given that you have infinite memory, what are the optimizations you can do to improve the performance
