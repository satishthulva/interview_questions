/**
 * <pre>
 * Let's say there is a war going on between tow kingdoms.
 * 
 * Each soldier has a capacity to withstand certain number of arrows.
 * The army stands in a line such that only one soldier is visible to the enemy at any point of time.
 * 
 * Arrows from enemy camp will be fired in batches. As soon as a soldier gets hit by his/her capacity,
 * the soldier goes down and the next soldier in-line will be exposed to the arrows. Assume that if there 
 * are any leftover arrows in the previous batch will be hit to the next soldier in-line as long as there are
 * any remaining soldiers.
 * 
 * If there are any arrows left in the batch that kills the last soldier, they'll be wasted. Immediately 
 * after that, all the soldiers will be resurrected by the King and come back to the battle again.
 * 
 * Please print the number of soldiers remaining at the end of every batch of arrows.
